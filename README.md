BukkitGames
===========

The old version of the BukkitGames plugin. For the new one go to https://github.com/ftbastler/BukkitGames-2.0

Source of BukkitGames v1.x is now open source, as long as you follow these rules:
- You must name the BukkitGames publicly anywhere you are using its code (e.g. on a server's website, if you are using the code for a private plugin or in the source AND on the download page for a public plugin)
- "Code snippets" by other developers are excluded from this, instead you will have look at their licenses
